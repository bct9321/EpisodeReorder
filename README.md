# EpisodeReorder
Easy way to take a file list of episodes and rename them by a season starting each season at episode 001 

You must have php installed and runnable from commandline.

Run the bat file and follow the instructions.
Pass in the directory of a season one at a time.
Note the directory you pass must only have the episodes you are renamin.

You will be provided a preview before you approve the renaming so make sure its correct!

PHP was chosen simply because I am most comfortable with that.
This was not meant to be well written but rather a fun project to see if i could do it faster than manually renaming files.
